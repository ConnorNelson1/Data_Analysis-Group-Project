    "The dataset that our group is working with is the arrest data of Chapel Hill, North Carolina from the years 2010 to 2016. Features include the date and time the arrest was made, as well as the address of the arrest. The crime committed is given to us as a classification of a felony or a misdemeanor, a UCR code, and a short description of the crime. The arrestee is described with features of age, race, sex, and ethnicity. The dataset has 18,809 rows and 11 features (columns).\n",

    "This data is compiled off of arrests made by the police officers from the Chapel Hill police department. The idividuals listed are not necessarily convited of the crimes they are listed as arrested for. This is purely who was arrested by police. This includes anyone that was arrested, booked, and released later on in the evening and anyone arrested that might be not be guilty of the crime they allegedly committed. This does not measure the crime rate, as any crime that went unreproted, not suspect was arrested, or the perpatrator was dead or killed before they could be apprehended, were not measured in this study. Only the arrests made, and the corresponding offenses justifying arrest."
